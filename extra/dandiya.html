             Dandiya Raas is the most popular dance of Gujarat. The dance is so popular that it is performed not only in the state, but throughout India. Infact, it is a special feature of the Navratri festival. The festival is celebrated to pay homage to the nine incarnations of Mata Amb, the Mother Goddess. People observe fasts on all nine days of the festival and pay regular visits to temples. While the days are filled with devotion towards the deity, the nights are vibrant, reflecting the festive spirit at its peak. Special arrangements are made for Dandia dance performances. Even the state government organizes special event for the enjoyment of the people.

Dandia is usually done in a group, by both men and women. The special feature of the dance is the colorful attire worn by the dancers and the colorful sticks carried by them. The sticks are used as prop and are beautifully decorated. It is for this reason the dance is also called the 'Stick Dance'. These sticks are usually made of bamboo, painted in different colors to make them look attractive. The performers hold sticks in both their hands and strike them together on the beats of the musical instruments. Dandiya Ras involves a huge number of people at a time. According to the dance setting, two circles are formed by the dancers.
There are several forms of Raas, but "Dandiya Raas", performed during Navaratri in Gujarat is the most popular form. Other forms of Raas include Dang Lila from Rajasthan where only one large stick is used, and "Rasa lila" from North India. Raas Lila and Dandiya Raas are similar. Some even consider "Garba" as a form of Raas, namely "Raas Garba".

                 The Navratri festival is celebrated to pay homage to the nine incarnations of Mata Ambe, the Mother Goddess. People all over the country observe fasts on all nine days of the festival and pay regular visits to temples. While the days are filled with devotion towards the deity, the nights are vibrant, reflecting the festive spirit at its peak. Special arrangements are made for Dandiya dance performances. The state government of Gujarat organizes special event for Dandiya for the entertainment of the people. The festival is very popular during the season in October.
Another identifiable feature of dandiya is its dress code. The dress code for women and men are different. For women it is a three-piece ghagra, cholis, and odhni. Men in Dandiya dress up in matching colourful traditional dhotis and aangrakha or kurtas with loads of mirrors on the dress.
In Dandiya Raas men and women dance in two circles, with sticks in their hands. In the old times Raas did not involve much singing, just the beat of Dhol was enough. "Dandiya" or sticks, are about 18" long. Each dancer holds two, although some times when they are short on Dandiya they will use just one in right hand. Generally, in a four beat rhythm, opposite sides hit the sticks at the same time, creating a nice sound. One circle goes clockwise and another counter clockwise. In the west, people don't form full circles, but instead often form rows.

                  Steps involved in the dance
It is a very simple dance and is performed by a group who move in circles to measure steps, marking time by sticks called Dandiya. Dandiya are the featured dances of Navratri evenings in Gujarat. The sticks of the dance represent the sword of Durga. Women normally perform it in a graceful and rhythmic manner in a circle as they rotate around the 'mandvi'. The women in Dandiya wear traditional dresses such as colorful embroidered choli, ghagra and bandhani dupattas dazzling with mirror work and heavy jewellery. The major difference between the 'Garba' and 'Dandiya' dance performances is that Garba is performed before 'Aarti' while Dandiya is performed after it. Garba is performed exclusively by women, men and women join in for Dandiya. Also known as 'stick dance' as performers use a pair of colorfully decorated sticks as props, the circular movements of Dandiya Raas are slightly more complex than that of Garba.
One of the circles revolves clockwise, while the other revolves anti clockwise. The dance is a very energetic and fast paced activity, which leaves no scope for lethargy. The dancers are accompanied by an instrument player with a 'meddale' drum. The person stands in the center of the two circles and leads the dancers with his beats. The site of hundreds of people swaying on the beats of folk music is awe-inspiring. The sticks or the Dandiyas, when struck together in a rhythm, produce foot tapping musical waves. The best Raas dancers of the region are the Kathiawari Ras dancers from Saurashtra.

The colorful sticks, used as prop of Dandiya Raas, are usually made of bamboo. This is the reason why it is also known as 'stick dance'. The circular movements of Dandiya Raas to some extent are very complex, which can be done only with skill in the art form. The dancers strike the sticks with their partners and dance in circular motion, to the rhythm of the music played in the background. A large number of people are involved in Dandiya Raas and two circles are formed by the dancers. 

Out of the two circles made to perform Dandiya Raas, one of the circles revolves clockwise, while the other revolves anti clockwise. The dance is a very lively, active and fast paced art form, thus leaving no scope for laziness. There is an instrumentalist, playing a 'meddale' drum, who accompanies the dancers. The person stands in the center of the two circles and leads the dancers with his beats. The dancers spin and move their feet and arms in a choreographed manner to the tune of the music, with lots of drum beats. Dandiya Raas in Navratri is a mesmerizing thing to watch as well as to participate in.
