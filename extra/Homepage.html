<b>Lord of Dance </b>
</div>

</div><p>
    In Hindu mythology, dance is believed to have been conceived by Brahma. Brahma inspired the sage Bharata Muni to write the Natya 
    Shastra, a treatise on performing arts, from which a codified practice of dance and drama emerged.He used pathya (words) from the 
    Rigveda, abhinaya (gestures) from the Yajurveda, geet (music) from the Samaveda and rasa (emotions) from the Atharvaveda to form the 
    Natyaveda (body of knowledge about dance).The best-known of Hindu deities—Shiva, Kali and Krishna—are typically represented dancing.
    Shiva's cosmic dance, tandava, Kali's dance of creation and destruction and Krishna's dance with the gopikas (cow-herd girls)—Rasa Lila
    —are popular motifs in Hindu mythology.
</p><p>
  In ancient India, there were no dedicated auditorium halls or theaters, and dance was usually a functional activity dedicated to worship,  entertainment or leisure. Dancers usually performed in temples, on festive occasions and seasonal harvests. Dance was performed on a   regular basis before deities as a form of worship.Even in modern India, deities are invoked through religious folk dance forms from   ancient times.Classical dance forms such as Bharata Natyam use mudras or hand gestures also to retell episodes of mythological tales such  as the slaying of Kaliya by Krishna.                    
</p><p>
  Nataraja or Nataraj, The Lord (or King) of Dance; is a depiction of the god Shiva as the cosmic dancer who performs his divine dance to 
  destroy a weary universe and make preparations for the god Brahma to start the process of creation.

                                Kathak is the major classical dance form of northern India.  The word kathak means "to tell a story".  
                                It is derived from the dance dramas of ancient India. Today, the story-telling aspect has been downgraded 
                                and the dance is primarily an abstract exploration of rhythm and movement.
