              Chhau dance is a genre of Indian tribal martial dance which is popular in the Indian states of Odisha, Jharkhand and West Bengal. There are three subgenres of the dance, based 
             on its places of origin and development, Seraikella Chhau, Mayurbhanj Chhau and Purulia Chhau. The Chhau dance is mainly performed during regional festivals, especially the spring 
             festival of Chaitra Parva which lasts for thirteen days and in which the whole community participates. The Chhau blends within it forms of both dance and martial practices employing 
            mock combat techniques (called khel), stylized gaits of birds and animals (called chalis and topkas) and movements based on the chores of village housewives (called uflis). The dance 
            is performed by male dancers from families of traditional artists or from local communities and is performed at night in an open space, called akhada or asar, to traditional and folk 
            music, played on the reed pipes mohuri and shehnai. A variety of drums accompany the music ensemble including the dhol (a cylindrical drum), dhumsa (a large kettle drum) and kharka or 
           chad-chadi. The themes for these dances include local legends, folklore and episodes from the Ramayanaand Mahabharata and other abstract themes.The Chhau dance is mainly performed by 
           the Munda, Mahato, Kalindi, Pattnaik, Samal, Daroga, Mohanty, Acharya, Bhol, Kar, Dubey, and Sahoo communities. The musical accompaniment for the dance is provided by people of 
           communities known as Mukhis, Kalindis, Ghadheis and Dhadas who are also involved in the making of the instruments. Masks form an integral part of Chhau Dance in Purulia and Seraikella 
           where the craft of mask-making is undertaken by communities of traditional painters known as Maharanas, Mohapatras and Sutradhars. The knowledge of dance, music and mask-making is 
           transmitted orally.

                   The Seraikella Chhau developed in Seraikela, the present day administrative headquarters of the Seraikela Kharsawan district of Jharkhand, the Purulia Chau in Purulia district of West 
                 Bengal and the Mayurbhanj Chhau inMayurbhanj district of Odisha. The most prominent difference among the three subgenres is regarding the use of masks. While, the Seraikela and Purulia 
                 subgenres of Chhau use masks, the Mayurbhanj Chhau uses none.
<h4>Seraikella Chau</h4>  
Seraikella, a small town in the Singhbhum district Bihar, is an arid flat land surrounded by low lying hills, which have protected her from external threats and saved her from subjugating to any 
  foreign rule. Only as late as 1820 the princely state signed a treaty with British but continued to enjoy freedom including celebration of religious rites. Probably this free state from external 
  influence enabled Seraikella to preserve its uniqueness. It is said that a former king apprehensive about inevitable inflow of outsiders, did not accept the proposal to connect Seraikella with a 
  railway. Today to reach Seraikella one has to arrive at the steel city Tatanagar by taking six hour train ride from Calcutta and then proceed to the town by bus.  The Chau dance in Seraikella and 
  the surrounding villages, including Purulia and Mayurbhanj, are performed as part of the annual festival Chaitra Parva. Throughout India several religious festivities, often followed by dance and 
  dance dramas, are related to the agricultural cycle that coincides with the phase of moon and transition of sun from equinox or one constellation to the next. The completion of one agricultural 
  cycle is marked by the beginning of a new cycle and it is this continuous rhythm of life and creation is celebrated in several ways. The month of Chaitra (March-April) heralds Spring and the new 
  cycle of agriculture. The next 15 days or more, till mid May, the most import time of the year is celebrated as the New Year in many regions, particularly Seraikella, neighboring regions and
  several parts of India.  In Seraikella, as also in Purulia and Mayurbhanj , minimum a week before the sun's transition on 14th April, elaborate rituals are offered to lord Shiva and His consort 
  Shakti. Unfortunately, due to political and economic situation and the dissolution of princely state, the king who was the chief patron of the rituals, is now unable to carryout the traditional 
 rituals with the traditional pomp and show. At the same time, people's faith in these rituals is diluted due to modernization and education. Such socio-economic and political reasons have reduced the 
 duration of ritual-celebration from 26 to 13 days or just last four days. Three days prior to the sun's transition, i.e. on 10th April, the first ritual Jatraghat is performed. Prior to this day on 
  Tuesday (if 10th April happens to fall on Tuesday itself then on the same afternoon) an auspicious pitcher- Mangalaghat is propitiated by only women. They observe fast and other austerities 
   throughout the day and fall into trance while carrying the pitcher on their heads. Several devotees offer sacrifices of fowls. Remarkably enough after this initiation of the rituals by women, 
   men folk take over completely. Women are avoided in rituals as well as in dance.

                  <h4>Purulia Chau </h4> 
Due to lack of sustained patronage and guidance the Purulia Chau show very little evolvement since its hunting or warfare origin. Performed by the early inhabitants of this arid region, 
it is almost an antithesis of sophisticated and stylized Seraikella form.  Brief and simple rituals precede the dance performed that are conducted in front of a Shiva temple or the village 
square. The village head is the patron and he carries a brass pitcher on his head to his house where his wife sprinkles the water of the pitcher on the newly harvested crop. Later, in the month,
   around 14th of May more elaborate rituals are offered to the sun god. Many devotees observe austerities including piercing their bodies with iron hook. On a high poll they are suspended and whirled 
 round on 'chadak' to suggest the progression of the sun in different constellations throughout the year. Till the early decades of this century these dancers and the form were patronized by the Bagmundi
 ruler, but due to unproductive land and ever failing rains the ruler could hardly provide necessary support. The performers too were forced to migrate to nearby urban city like Calcutta in search of living. 
Since 1961, when this form was first witnessed by an anthropologist in a remote village of Purulia district and their subsequent visits in major cities world over, the locals have formed their own 'parties'
in anticipation of a sponsored trip abroad. They have added more 'exciting' combat scenes with more skillful pirouettes and summersault. The costumes specially the headgears have acquired enormous size 
and jazzy decorations.  Influenced by the more respected Hindu culture the natives adopted the epical themes but they naturally opted for the warfare scenes that would reflect their life of perpetual 
hardships and conflict with nature itself. Even the characters the noble and heroic characters like Rama and Sita are depicted with forceful gestures. 
<h4>Mayurbhanj Chau  </h4>
The royals of Mayurbhanj district of Orissa maintained long and sustained political and marital relation with the Seriakella royal family, the latter sent a Chau master who influenced the dance style in 
Baripada and nearby villages.  During the Chaitra Parba celebrations the dances in Baripada villages is preceded by elaborate rituals with some modifications in the rituals observed in Seraikella. 
The noticeable feature of this form is that since the elimination of masks the body kinetics has changed considerably. The wider leg extensions, the flexion of the torso or the subtle jerks of the shoulders 
to punctuate the rhythmic cycle have all become more pronounced and strenuous. The basic technique, as repeatedly claimed by the writers and scholars , is believed to be derived from the martial art of sword 
and shield play; although the complex body movements are derived from the phenomenon in nature or animal world or the household chores of a woman. The combination of these units are then employed in the 
interpretative dances based on the epics. Yet one of the oldest and the most popular item is Shabar or the hunter dance .And this reiterates the relevance of hunting occupation of the early inhabitants 
in this tribal belt , irrespective of the refinement of the stylization the dances attained in the due course of time.  The patronizing royal family of this form did not take active interest in the 
development of this form like their counterparts in Seraikella but they encouraged healthy competition among two groups, Dakshin sahi and Uttar sahi , situated on the either sides of the river bank. 
Today this competitive spirit attracts several Chau groups and thousands of spectators who sit through the night long performance.  The elimination of mask has encouraged many female dancers of the other 
styles recently to learn this unique body language with strong body kinetics.
