       I am a big follower of famous artworks around the world and I myself love painting and sketching whenever I get free time. When I got to know that 
            I have to create a project ,<b> Ashart Gallery</b> was first thing in my mind. I referred to many different seniors websites and searched a lot about APIs that can fetch me artworks.
             I came across various art museums that provided free APIs and finally I was able to implement my idea .

            Making famous artwork accesible at one place is a wonderful idea for me. Each masterpiece has a story and history. I wanted to display all freely accesible artworks under one platform.
            A person who wants to search for particular art work or artist can come to my website and have a look.

             I would like to thank<b> Prof. Rasala</b> for giving me this opportunity.
