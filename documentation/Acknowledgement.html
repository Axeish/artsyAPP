      I would like to take this opportunity to express my acknowledgement to Professor Richard Rasala for his guidance,
           constant encouragement throughout this course(Web Development CS 5610). Under his mentorship, 
            I have gathered so much of knowledge about web technologies. The  wealth of resources provided 
            on Prof. Rasala's webpage helped me a lot in learning these new advanced technologies from the start. 
            Prof. Rasala has given suggestions to me regarding debugging of my project and also guided me through the finalization 
            of my project idea.

I would also like to extend my thanks to Prof. Jose Annunziato who has provided wonderful guest lectures.  
        <p>
            I would like to express special gratitude to Pruthvi Kumar (TA) who has been a constant support throughout this course. He has always given his attention and time to my problems
