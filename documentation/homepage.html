     My homepage has a search option that I have implemented using Javascript and AJAX with the help of API provided by artsy. The viewer has option to either search for artists or search for artworks. 
            If search type is artist it will display link to the artist .
            in case of artwork it will have artworks and art title will be displayed
            <h4>Search artist</h4>
             <img src="../images/slide/d5.jpg" />
       
            <h4>Searc artwork</h4>
             <img src="../images/slide/d6.jpg" />
