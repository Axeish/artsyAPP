     Here I have implemented a drop down menu containing list of Famous Artist. The Implementation here uses two JSON request. One Request is used to retrieve detail information about artist that is been selected which will give list of ids of their artwork.
            I have used each of the artwork IDs retrieved to make another JSON request that will fetch detailed information like when created, medium , institution owned of each of the artworks.

            To display images I have used substring , string length function of javascript to edit URL of thumbnail to get URL of high quality larger images. 
            <br />

            <br />
            I have purposely made the artworks non responsive because I feel that if I had made artworks responsive then shrink in image of prestigious artwork will be disrespectful and will degrade quality.
