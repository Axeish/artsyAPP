            Ashish Kumar, Hi I am a student at Northeastern University currently pursuing Masters in Computer Science. I always had interest in art and Ashart Gallery for me is an excellent opportunity . I have myself done lots of artworks during my free time. I can play with colors on canvas very well along with show creative skills on Photoshop and Illustrator. I have done lot of craft works along too. Visit mywork link on top to see more. I have learned art by myself and I believe anyone can learn it if really interested.



I hope you enjoy this website. For any questions or suggestion feel free to email at kumar.as@husky.neu.edu
